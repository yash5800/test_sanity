# SanityHub

SanityHub is a simple, lightweight, and secure platform where users can **store files online and access them from anywhere**.  
It works with a **unique key-based login system**, meaning you don’t need traditional usernames or passwords. Just use your key (for example: `test`) to log in and manage your files.
